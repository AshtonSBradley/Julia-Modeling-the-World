      "# Mandelbrot Set\n",

      "This notebook shows how to implement and visualize the [Mandelbrot Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) in Julia. The Mandelbrot set is a very well known and beautiful fractal discovered in the 70s. It was named after Benoit Mandelbrot, a well-known mathematician. The first images of this object were computed in 1978.\n",

      "The basic idea behind the Mandelbrot set is that you have a 2D plane that represents an image. Each point of that plane is a complex number $z = x + y i$. Now, suppose what happens if, for each point $c$ in the plane, you iterate over and over calculating a new number as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ z_{n+1} \\gets z_{n}^2 + c$$"

     "source": [
      "In this formula $z_0 = 0$ and $c$ is the point in the plane you are looking at. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this situation, two different things can happen. As the number of iterations advances either $\\|z\\|$ tends to infinity or it tends to 0. Mathematicaly, points where it tends to zero, are part of the set and are colored black. Points that tend to infinity are not part of the set and are colored white. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since in a computer you cannot iterate an infinite number of times, typically you put a bound on how many times you do this calculation. Also, you can use the \"how fast\" $\\|z\\|$ is going to infinity to color the set much more nicely. You can also check if $z$ is going to infinity just by comparing $\\|z\\|$ with 2. If it has grown that big, it certainly is not part of the set.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for a point $c$, lets define a function `mandel_pt()` that tells us the number of iterations that point is taking to diverge to infinity. (Note: points that are truly inside the set will take `MAX_ITER` iterations. We will map those to zero as it makes for nicer colors.)"
